<!-- Hydejack is a complete, interactive, configureable, responsive, reactive[^r], mobile-first, touch-enabled, animated, [jankfree], printable, tab-able, fast[^1], search engine-friendly and robust [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme that feels like a modern web app, while preserving what is great about *web pages*: Working URLs, hyperlinks, a working back button, a working refresh button and less than 50MB of JavaScript[^2] (tongue-in-cheek).

It can be hosted on GitHub Pages, where it has support for categories and tags, math blocks via KaTeX,
opt-in comments via Disqus, multiple authors [enumerate more features] and that's just the free version[^3].

The site works all the way down to IE10; IE9 if you don't need fancy animations, and IE5 if you don't need fancy anything.
Rumor has it, you can even view it via [`lynx`](http://lynx.browser.org/). -->

**NOTE**: Hydejack is a Jekyll theme. As a user of Jekyll, it is assumed that yo are comfortable with editing text files and running shell commands. If you'd like to see Hydejack on another platform, please let me know.

<!-- \* Part of the "PRO" verison of Hydejack. -->

[^1]: Perceived speed: Latency hidden through complex pre-fetching logic and animations. Load speed: Inlining styles and removing other requests from the critical rendering path.
[^r]: Uses `RxJS` internally.
[^2]: In fact, all of Hydejack's JS is optional and not part of the critical rendering path.
[^3]: The "PRO" version offers what you would need for a professional web presence: A [projects page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) with [detail view]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/hydejack-v6), a [welcome page]({{ site.baseurl }}/welcome) that highlights your favorite projects and posts, and a [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume).
