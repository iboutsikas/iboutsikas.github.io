Thank you for buying the PRO version of Hydejack! ðŸŽ‰

One year ago I was looking for a blogging platform but couldn't find it: One that would let me write posts in markdown with my own editor, one that didn't look awful buy modern design standards and one that felt snappy on a mobile phone. That and more is now Hydejack. I hope you enjoy it [as much as I do](https://qwtel.com).

## First Steps
Please start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading data-flip="title"}. Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant to you:

* [Installation]{:.heading data-flip="title"} -- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Configuration]{:.heading data-flip="title"} -- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.
* [Migration]{:.heading data-flip="title"} -- You can skip this if you haven't used Hydejack before.

## Support
Should you have any trouble with the theme, you can send me an email at [f.klampfer@gmail.com](mailto:f.klampfer@gmail.com). I try to answer request within 1 business day, and sometimes I answer instantly, when a mail makes it though Google's low priority filter ðŸ˜‰
