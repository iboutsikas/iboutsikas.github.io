<!-- What's great about static sites is that you have a solid foundation to fall back on. For example, I took great care to make the client side page transitions [as solid as possible](/why-push-state), but should anything go wrong, a page reload can always fix it. This is where the real value of progressive enhancement lies: You get to sleep at night. -->
