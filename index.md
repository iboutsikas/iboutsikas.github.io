## Hydejack
Hydejack is a cutting-edge Jekyll theme that combines the best of static sites and modern web apps. It features a suite of JavaScript that makes the page feel like an app, without sacrificing backwards-compatibility, page-load speed or SEO.

> The complete package for professionals: A [blog], a [portfolio] and a [resume].
{:.lead}

It aims to be the complete package for professionals on the web. It features a blog suitable for both prose and technical documentation, a showcase for projects and a resume that fits with the rest of the design.

Oh, and there's also the welcome layout, which features the author's *short description*, some arbitrary *content*, as well as *selected projects* and *selected posts*.

[^1]: Applies after the initial page load.
[^2]: Actual page load speed depends on your hosting provider as well as discipline regarding resolution of images and usage of 3rd party plugins.

[blog]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link blog.md %}
[portfolio]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}
[resume]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% link resume.md %}
