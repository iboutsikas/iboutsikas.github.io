Welcome to my personal page. I am Ioannis a Software Engineer with experience in
various areas including; AAA games, Desktop and Web development, and tutoring.

My primary interest is in game engine development and I am working on my own
personal engine when time permits. I also spend a sizable amount of time doing
home improvement projects, but that is more of necessity turned into a hobby.

Please feel free to read more about the [Games]() I've worked on or my
[Projects]().
