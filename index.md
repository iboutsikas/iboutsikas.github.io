Welcome to my personal page. I am Ioannis Boutsikas, you can also call me John
(it is the same name, I promise!). I am a Software Engineer with plenty of
experience in web development and web related stuff. My passion however has
always been games and graphics so I now have the chance to work on and research
that! In fact, I am currently working on my own rendering engine that implements
decoupled, asynchronous shading!

Please take a look at my [Projects](/projects) or maybe
[Publications](/publications) to see what I've been up to, or better yet read
about my [rendering engine](/projects/titanium-rose/).


In my down time I do tinker a lot with my homelab among other things. For my
fellow homelabers, you can take a quick look at my [homelab](/homelab).
