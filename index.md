Welcome to my personal page. I am a Software Engineer with a focus on graphics
and game development, as well as plent of web and web related experience. My
 primary interest is game engines themselves, and specifically their graphics
 and graphics adjacent systems. For the past 1.5-2 years I have been working on
 [Ara: History Untold](https://www.arahistoryuntold.com/){:target="_blank"
 rel="noopener"} with the talented folks at [Oxide
 Games](https://www.oxidegames.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Most of
 my work has been in the space between UI and graphics merging my two
 backgrounds well.

You can read about my personal [Projects](/projects) or
[Publications](/publications) or better yet my [rendering
engine](/projects/titanium-rose/), which focuses on decoupled, asynchronous
shading.
